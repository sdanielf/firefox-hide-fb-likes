Hide likes on Facebook notifications (Firefox extension)
========================================================

Are you bothered by "someone likes your post" notifications on Facebook?

Hide Likes on Facebook Notifications is for you!

You won't miss more important notifications such as "someone commented on
your status".

This extension hides only "like" notifications. Other types of notifications
stay visible.

This is a port of the
[Chrome extension](https://github.com/zerobase/fb_hide_like_notifs).
